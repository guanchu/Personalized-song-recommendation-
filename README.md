# Personalized-song-recommendation-

   Singing is a good way to express one's feelings. However, users may have unsuccessful singing performance if they fail to choose a suitable song.

   Distinguished from most existing music recommender system, this project aims to study singing-song
 recommendation with respect to users' own voicing capabilities.

   To reveal the characteristics of voice, a singer profile has been generated in 'data'.
